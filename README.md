# Iris-Support-Vector-Machine
A sophisticated SVM with Dimensionality for non-linearly separable data
Implemented a program using sklearn library catering to the dual problems and used Kernal functions to move data to higher dimensions in case it is non linearly separable in its native state. <br>
This implementation uses 4 different kernels to find the most optimized values of alpha for high prediction confidence.
